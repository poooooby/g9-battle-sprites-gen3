# g9-battle-sprites

True-colour, **frame-animated battle sprites** for the whole national dex,
loaded from the **DBK animated "solo sprites"** pack
(`la-base-de-sky / la-base-de-sky-plugins / sprites-animados-dbk-solo-sprites`,
folders `Graphics/Pokemon/{Front, Front shiny, Back, Back shiny}`).

It replaces the enemy **front** pic and the player **back** pic in battle with
the matching animated sheet, the **front pic on the Pokedex** entry page — on
gen1 that is the **national dex's own Pokédex screen**, its **STATS page** and
its LEFT/RIGHT **form browsing** included — the **party Summary screen's
front pic**, on the native screen (gen1 and gen2) and on any custom screen that
replaces it (e.g. the g9 battle engine's wide modern STATS screen), and the
little **16×16 icon on each party-list row** (gen1 and gen2 — from the mod's own
bundled animated icon atlas, not the sheet; see [PARTY ICONS](#party-icons-the-bundled-icon-atlas)). With the opt-in
**G9 PARTY SCREEN** row it can also redraw the **whole party page** from the
game's own parts on a 640×576 surface (4× the Game Boy screen), so the pack's
icons show at their natural 64×64 size — see [G9 PARTY SCREEN](#g9-party-screen-the-4x-page). In battle it also bakes the Tera-crystal film over a transformed Pokemon, grows a
Dynamaxed one through its size ladder, and draws a **contact shadow** behind
every battler (see [TERA ART](#tera-art-the-crystal-film),
[DYNAMAX GROW](#dynamax-grow-the-size-ladder) and
[BATTLE SHADOWS](#battle-shadows-the-contact-shadow)). Everything
else — the send-out grow, faint slide, blink/squish,
the SGB/GBC palette machinery — keeps working, because the mod hands the
engine's own draw path a normal LÖVE `Image` per frame.

## The one decision that shapes everything: use the sheet directly

Every file in the pack is **one PNG per Pokemon**, laid out as a single
horizontal strip of frames that butt edge to edge, left to right, where
`frame height == sheet height` and
`frame count == round(width / height)`.

So there is **no splitting step and no per-Pokemon subfolders**. The mod:

1. decodes the sheet once — through up to three fallback routes, since a mod
   cannot assume any one image decoder exists on a given build: the engine's own
   asset path first (`love.image.newImageData(mod.assets:path(...))`, what every
   image-loading mod uses), then the raw bytes via a `FileData`, then a
   `love.graphics.newImage(path):getData()` detour,
2. crops each frame out of it **in memory**,
3. resamples that frame **once** to the on-screen pic box — at the largest
   scale that box allows (see [Sizes and alignment](#sizes-and-alignment)) — and
   offsets it by the pack's own metrics, then caches the result.

The raw PNG stays a single file under `assets/<type>/<STEM>.png`. You copy one
`.png` per Pokemon — never a folder of frames.

## Lookup (for each battle pic)

1. **the running game's species id** (+ gender + shiny) → a **DBK stem** via
   `data/dbk_data.lua`. The running dex is whatever the game has: with
   `national_dex` installed it is the expanded one, and without it the cart's
   own — a species only `national_dex` knows simply never appears, and every
   lookup is keyed off a live mon (or a dex entry the game is showing), so
   sprites are only ever applied to species present in the available dex.
2. `<mod>/assets/<front|front_shiny|back|back_shiny>/<STEM>.png` — your local
   copy. **This is the only source: the mod does not touch the network.**

Stems/ids are matched exactly; a lookup that cannot resolve falls through to the
vanilla pic, so a missing sheet is never an error on screen. A sheet that
resolves nowhere is **not** latched as dead — it is retried every ~15 s, so a
file copied into `assets/` while the game is running is picked up on the next
recheck without a restart.

Fill `assets/` by hand, or with the helper script that ships in the mod (see
[Getting the sheets](#getting-the-sheets-the-helper-script)).

## Form conventions (the part that needed care)

The national dex gives every *mechanically or sprite-distinct* form its own
species id, and `data/dbk_data.lua` maps each id to **the pack's own stem**.
Examples baked into the data:

| national dex id | DBK stem | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `CHARIZARD_MEGA_X` | `CHARIZARD_1` | Mega Charizard X |
| `CHARIZARD_MEGA_Y` | `CHARIZARD_2` | Mega Charizard Y |
| `CHARIZARD_GMAX` | `CHARIZARD_3` | Gigantamax Charizard |
| `RAICHU_ALOLA` | `RAICHU_1` | Alolan Raichu |
| `SNEASEL_HISUI` | `SNEASEL_1` | Hisuian Sneasel |
| `ALCREMIE_GMAX` | `ALCREMIE_63` | Gigantamax Alcremie |
| `MEOWSTIC_FEMALE` | `MEOWSTIC_1` | Female Meowstic |
| `BASCULEGION_FEMALE` | `BASCULEGION_1` | Female Basculegion |
| `OINKOLOGNE_FEMALE` | `OINKOLOGNE_1` | Female Oinkologne |

**Ignored forms.** Cosmetic-only forms the pack has no sheet for (e.g. every
Alcremie flavour that is not base or gigantamax) are *not* mapped; they fall
back to the base species sheet. That matches the pack's own intent — base
`ALCREMIE`, gmax `ALCREMIE_63`, everything else irrelevant.

**Base fallback.** If an id is not mapped at all (totems, story-only modes like
`PIKACHU_STARTER`, `KORAIDON`/`MIRAIDON` modes), the mod walks the `_SUFFIX`
chain off the id until it finds a mapped stem — e.g.
`KOMMO_O_TOTEM → KOMMO_O → KOMMOO` (note: the pack **drops underscores** in
species names: `MR_MIME → MRMIME`, `NIDORAN_F → NIDORANfE`,
`NIDORAN_M → NIDORANmA`).

**Female art.** Some Pokemon have a distinct `_female` sheet next to their base
one (`ABOMASNOW_female`, `SNEASEL_1_female`, `EEVEE_1_female`, ...). The
`female` set in `data/dbk_data.lua` lists the ones that exist; a female mon uses
`<stem>_female` when the set contains the **base** stem and FEMALE ART is on.

**Shiny art** uses the `*_shiny` folders when SHINY ART is on.

## Sizes and alignment

The pack draws every sheet at **one uniform scale** (Essentials/DBK's
`FRONT_BATTLER_SPRITE_SCALE = 2`, `BACK_BATTLER_SPRITE_SCALE = 3`), so a bigger
Pokemon is simply a **taller sheet**: relative sizes come straight from the
sheet's own pixel height.

**SPRITE SIZE** decides how much of a sheet's own resolution reaches the
screen. `MAX DETAIL` (0, the default) sizes each sheet on its own: a sheet that
already fits its picture box is kept **1:1** (a small Pokemon keeps every source
pixel), and a sheet that does not is shrunk **no further than it must be**, so a
big Pokemon fills the box instead of sitting at half size inside it. Relative
size is still honoured for everything that fits; sheets taller than the box all
land on the box, which is as large as the screen can show them anyway. `SMALL`
(3), `NORMAL` (2) and `BIG` (1) instead divide every sheet by that one whole
number, which keeps their relative sizes strictly proportional. Whatever the
mode, a sheet too big to fit the box is scaled back to it, so nothing is ever
clipped.

**GROUND ANCHOR** then decides the line a sprite stands on. `FEET` (the
default) is the one that makes every grounded Pokemon share a line: the pack's
sheets are **not** trimmed, so each species carries its own empty padding under
its feet — Zigzagoon's feet sit far higher up its sheet than Wooloo's — and
those padding differences must not move the Pokemon. We trim every sheet to its
content first, and `FEET` then always places that content's **bottom edge (the
feet) on the bottom of the picture**, so Zigzagoon and Wooloo land their feet
on exactly the same line however much space their sheets carried. The content is
centred horizontally at the same time. `PACK` uses the pack's own
`SpeciesMetrics` offsets (see below), and `BOX` simply bottom-centres with no
alignment at all — both kept for anyone who preferred the old look.

A Pokemon the pack draws **airborne** — a flying or levitating species — must
*not* sit its feet on that line. `FLOATERS` (on by default) lifts each of those
sheets off the ground by a share of its **own height** (35%), so a big flyer
hovers higher than a small one instead of every flyer floating at one fixed
height. The species list is `data/dbk_float.lua`; turning `FLOATERS` off puts
every sprite's feet back on the line. This only applies in `FEET` mode.

`PACK`'s arithmetic, for reference: the pack anchors a sheet's *untrimmed* frame
bottom-centre at a fixed base and shifts it by the metrics × 2 screen px. We
trim each sheet to its content first, so the padding the metrics assume is gone
and is put back with the same arithmetic Essentials/DBK use:

* the content bottom sits `padBot` rows above the frame bottom → `- padBot`;
* the content mid-x sits `(padL - padR) / 2` px off the frame mid-x, and our
  baseline centres the content → `- (padR - padL) / 2`.

`offset × 2 ÷ renderScale` converts a metric to sheet pixels, and the result
scales with the sprite, so alignment stays proportional at any SPRITE SIZE. The
final position is clamped inside the box, so nothing is ever baked off-canvas.

The battle screens do the rest: both the game's own battle screen and
`g9-Battle-Scene` draw a sprite **bottom-anchored on its slot's ground line**,
so the bottom edge of the image we hand them *is* the line the feet land on.
Keep that in mind if you fork the draw path.

**Baking always samples the nearest source pixel, never an average.** Each
destination pixel takes the single source pixel nearest its own centre. That
holds at a fractional scale too: a fractional *step* simply means neighbouring
destination pixels advance by different whole numbers of source pixels, so
every block stays square and every pixel keeps an exact colour from the pack's
palette. Hard edges and true colours are the whole point — and a box/area filter
is the one thing that destroys both, blending neighbouring colours into new ones
and reading as a soft, muddy smear beside the game's crisp pixel UI. (An earlier
build area-averaged at a fractional scale and produced exactly that: the
"blurry sprites" complaint.) A destination pixel whose nearest source pixel is
transparent borrows the nearest opaque pixel it covers, so a one-pixel outline
or antenna is never punched out by the sampling stride.

Changing SPRITE SIZE, GROUND ANCHOR or FLOATERS requeues every sheet, so the new
setting shows up in the next battle with no restart.

## Front-facing sprites (3DB FRONTAL / FLIP)

By default the player's Pokemon stands with its **back** to you (the back sheet)
while the foe shows its front — exactly what the game intends. Two rows let both
sides be drawn **front-on**:

* **3DB FRONTAL** (off by default) shows the player's Pokemon with its **front**
  sheet in place of its back sheet, so *both* Pokemon on the field are drawn
  front-on. It is a straight substitution: the back sprite is replaced by the
  frontal art with **no flip**.
* **3DB FLIP** (off by default) then mirrors that player-side front art
  **horizontally** (across its vertical axis), so a creature whose front art is
  drawn facing your left now faces **right**, toward the foe across the field.
  Only the player's side is mirrored — the foe already faces you. The flip is
  meant to be used together with 3DB FRONTAL: with 3DB FRONTAL off the player is
  showing its back sheet, and a back sprite is never mirrored, so the row does
  nothing on its own.

Both rows apply everywhere battle pics are drawn — the native gen1 and gen2
battle screens *and* every custom battle screen (`g9-Battle-Scene` and its
forks) — because all of them resolve through the same sheet factory. The mirror
is baked into **every frame** of the sheet, after the crystal and shadow
are composited, so the sprite and everything riding it turn together and stay
registered, and it can never flip mid-animation. Because the front-substituted
sheet is a distinct sheet in the cache, the player's slot keeps its own box and
ground line: the art changes, the placement does not. The Pokedex, the summary
and the party list already show front art and are untouched. Changing either row
requeues the affected sheets, so the new orientation shows up in the next battle
with no restart.

## Mod Manager options

| Row | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **BATTLE SPRITES** | on | Master switch. Off → every pic is exactly what the game would draw. |
| **ANIMATE** | on | Play the sheet left-to-right as a loop. Off → frame 1 only. |
| **SPRITE SPEED** | NORMAL (12 fps) | Playback speed: SLOW 6 / NORMAL 12 / FAST 18 / VERY FAST 24. |
| **SHINY ART** | on | Use `*_shiny` sheets for shiny mons. |
| **FEMALE ART** | on | Use `_female` sheets where the pack has one. |
| **SPRITE SIZE** | MAX DETAIL (0) | How much of each sheet's own resolution reaches the screen: MAX DETAIL 0 = the largest scale that fits each sheet's box (1:1 wherever it fits), SMALL 3 / NORMAL 2 / BIG 1 = divide every sheet by 3/2/1 for strictly proportional sizes. See [Sizes and alignment](#sizes-and-alignment). |
| **GROUND ANCHOR** | FEET | The line a sprite stands on. **FEET** (default) puts every grounded sprite's own feet on the bottom of its picture, so all grounded Pokemon share one ground line however much empty padding their sheets carry (Zigzagoon and Wooloo land their feet at the same height). **PACK** uses the pack's own SpeciesMetrics offsets. **BOX** bottom-centres with no alignment. See [Sizes and alignment](#sizes-and-alignment). |
| **FLOATERS** | on | In FEET mode, lift a sprite the pack draws airborne (a flying/levitating species, `data/dbk_float.lua`) off the ground by 35% of its own height, so a big flyer hovers higher than a small one. Off → every sprite stands its feet on the line. No effect in PACK or BOX mode. |
| **3DB FRONTAL** | off | Show the player's Pokemon with its **front** sheet on the battle field instead of its back sheet, so both Pokemon are drawn front-on (the foe already shows its front). A straight substitution — the back sprite is replaced by the frontal art with **no flip**. Applies to the native gen1/gen2 battle screens and every custom battle screen. See [Front-facing sprites](#front-facing-sprites-3db-frontal--flip). |
| **3DB FLIP** | off | Mirror the player's own front sprite **horizontally** (across its vertical axis), so a creature whose front art faces your left now faces right, toward the foe. Player side only — the foe already faces you. Meant to be used with 3DB FRONTAL; with that row off the player shows its back sheet and this row does nothing (a back sprite is never mirrored). See [Front-facing sprites](#front-facing-sprites-3db-frontal--flip). |
| **BATTLE SHADOWS** | on | Draw a contact shadow behind each battler so it stands on the field instead of floating. A species gets its own `assets/shadow/<STEM>.png` if present, otherwise the generic small/medium/large art chosen by the pack's `ShadowSize` (`ShadowSize 0` → no shadow); width tracks `ShadowSize`. See [BATTLE SHADOWS](#battle-shadows-the-contact-shadow). Off → no shadow is baked. |
| **DEX SPRITES** | on | Show the same sheet on the Pokedex front pic (first frame when ANIMATE is off) — on gen1 that includes the national dex's own Pokédex screen, its STATS page and its form browsing. Off → the Pokedex keeps the game's own pic. |
| **SUMMARY SPRITES** | on | Show the same sheet on every party Summary screen's front pic (the native screen and any custom screen replacing it) — the FRONT sheet, or `*_shiny` FRONT for a shiny mon. Off → summaries keep the game's own pic. |
| **SUMMARY SIZE** | REAL SIZE (100) | How big the Summary picture is drawn: REAL SIZE is the battle screen's own 1:1 front box, 75% / 50% / 25% draw the very same sheet smaller inside that box (centred, still animated, still true-colour). Summary only — battles, the Pokedex and custom scenes always keep the full-size picture. |
| **PARTY ICONS** | on | Draw each party-list row's little 16×16 icon from the mod's own **bundled animated icon atlas** (two true-colour frames per Pokemon, female variant where the pack has one) on both generations, wherever the party list is drawn — overworld and in battle. Off → the party list keeps the game's own two-colour icon art. |
| **G9 PARTY SCREEN** | off | Off (default) → the party list is the game's own 160×144 screen (with the PARTY ICONS art on it when that row is on). On → the whole party page is redrawn from the game's **own** parts — the same two-line rows (name, level, HP figures, HP-bar tiles, status/FNT), cursor, CANCEL row and box — from the tiles and fonts of whichever generation you are playing, in exactly the same proportions, but on a **640×576** page (4× the Game Boy screen, scaled to fill the window). That larger page is what lets each Pokemon's **high-resolution** icon art (`assets/icons/party_icons_hd.png`, the pack's natural 64×64 frames) be drawn at its own size instead of being shrunk into a 16×16 slot. The action list that opens when you pick a Pokemon (STATS / SWITCH / field moves / ITEM / CANCEL) is the game's own submenu, unchanged. See [G9 PARTY SCREEN](#g9-party-screen-the-4x-page). |
| **TERA ART** | on | While a Pokemon is Terastallized — or is a wild Tera raid boss announced by `g9-Battle-Scene` — bake the cut-crystal film (see [TERA ART](#tera-art-the-crystal-film)) into each frame: flat angular facets in a chaotic mix of broad slabs and small chips, fine dark bevel seams that carry the type's own tint, a glowing chamfered rim and small white 4-pointed star sparkles of pure light (no dark halo) that blink on their own cycle over the lightest facets, tinted with its Tera type — and the whole crystal rides the sprite's own animation instead of staying put. The state is read live from `battle_forms`, or from the raid declaration the screen hands over. Off → frames are plain. |
| **TERA TRANSPARENCY** | 30% | How see-through the TERA ART crystal is: 5 / 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 / 60%. The figure is how much of the Pokemon's own colours show **through** the crystal, so 30% is the 70/30 crystal-over-sprite blend the effect ships with, 5% is an almost solid gem and 60% is a sheer, glassy film. Only the crystal layer's own opacity changes — its facets, colours, bevel seams, rim, glints and sparkles are untouched. Does nothing when TERA ART is off. See [TERA ART](#tera-art-the-crystal-film). |
| **DYNAMAX GROW** | on | While a Pokemon is Dynamaxed or Gigantamaxed, grow its sprite through the phased size ladder — x1 → 1.05 (0.3s) → 1.10 (0.4s) → 1.20 (0.5s) → 1.50 (0.8s), each phase easing in on a parabolic curve — and when it reverts, **shrink back down the very same ladder at the very same rates** (a full 1.50 → 1.00 descent takes the same 2.00s the climb did), so the transformation reads forward and then in reverse (see [DYNAMAX GROW](#dynamax-grow-the-size-ladder)). The mod also exposes the state to a custom battle screen, so its darkened field and red aura ramp with the size. Off → a Dynamaxed mon is drawn at its normal size, though the state is still reported. Does nothing when the mod's own sprite path is off. |

Rows are declared in `options.lua` (so a disabled mod still shows them) and
mirrored in `main.lua`, which is what gives the values their defaults.

## TERA ART (the crystal film)

A Terastallized Pokemon wears a **cut-crystal** film tinted with its own Tera
type and blended **70/30** (70% crystal — the **TERA TRANSPARENCY** row tunes the
crystal's own share) into the sprite frame. The pattern is the one piece of
generated effect art the mod ships (`assets/tera_crystal.png`); every other
pixel is the shipped DBK sheets or the game's own contact-shadow art.

**The pattern is loaded lazily** (`TERA.loadPattern`, cached for the session): the
first type sheet that bakes decodes `assets/tera_crystal.png` through the same
three routes the sheet loader itself uses (path, then raw bytes, then Image), and
a missing or unreadable asset warns once and bakes **plain** sheets from then on
rather than failing. A shipped build before **3.2.4** had lost that loader -- the
call site existed but the function was never defined -- so the film's bake threw
and every type sheet silently fell back to its plain bake: the crystal layer
never appeared at all, on any Pokemon, however the live Tera state was resolved.
3.2.4 restores the loader, which is what actually makes the film land at the
break.

**Only the creature is covered, never its frame.** The film is not a second,
transparent draw pass over the pic box — that would tint the box's invisible
margin and show as a tinted rectangle around the creature. Instead the film is
composited into the **baked frame** at the same moment the frame is resampled,
and a destination pixel only ever receives the film when that pixel came from a
**sprite pixel with alpha > 0**. A transparent frame pixel stays exactly as
transparent as before. The upshot: the silhouette you see is the sheet's own
silhouette, and the crystal can never leak past it.

**A cut gem, built in code.** The film is not the pattern's own soft mosaic
painted straight onto the sprite — at sprite scale that reads as a blur. Instead
the crystal is *cut* into flat shards by a **free-scatter Voronoi lattice**
(`TERA.buildMap`). The sites do not sit on a grid at all: `FACET_SITES` = 180
hash-chosen points are scattered freely over the padded box, which is the only
way to be rid of the rows and columns of seams that any amount of grid jitter
leaves behind — and those rows and columns are exactly what read as a
checkerboard instead of as shattered glass. Each site's cell becomes one
irregular convex plane. The **clustering** is what gives the pane its range of
scales: `FACET_MIX` = 0.8 of the sites are placed around one of the others,
`FACET_MIX_RADIUS` = 1.4 nominal pitches away, so a cluster packs into a field of
small chips while the space between clusters is left to a single site, which
becomes a slab.

The scatter is then held inside a **size band**, both ends expressed as multiples
of the nominal cell area (box area / `FACET_SITES`). `FACET_MIN` = 0.3 folds every
shard below the floor into its **largest** 4-neighbour (`TERA.pickNeighbour` — by
area, not by longest shared edge, because it is the small end of the distribution
that needs pushing up: a chip is absorbed by whichever side is already the
broadest). `FACET_MAX` = 2.2 splits every shard above the ceiling along a wavy
line through its own centroid, repeatedly, until the biggest one is under it;
`FACET_CRACK_BEND` = 0.35 is how far that line wanders (0 is a ruler-straight cut,
which reads as an artificial slice rather than a fracture). A crack that would
leave one side empty is abandoned and the shard is flagged so the search passes
it by instead of spinning on it, and `FACET_SPLIT_GUARD` = 4000 caps the attempts
(it is headroom, not a cost: each split only walks that one shard's own pixels).
The floor pass then runs **again after** the cracks, because a crack can leave a
sliver on one side of the cut. Holding both ends is what lets the *mean* shard be
small — the density is high — without any individual shard shrinking to a speck
of dirt on the glass or growing into one dominating plate. Measured over a solid
56px box (the shard probe's interior areas, the same method the old numbers
came from): the old jittered grid gave ~18 shards of 55–132px, mean 87, cv 0.21;
this gives ~70 shards of 3–56px, mean 23, cv 0.62 — the smallest shard is about
10% of the old smallest, the largest about 40% of the old largest, and the size
spread roughly triples. Every shard carries exactly **one flat colour**, so the
surface breaks into hard-edged planes like a cut stone instead of a continuous
gradient. The lattice depends only on the box and the pattern — both identical
for every sheet — so it is built once and cached (`TERA._maps`, keyed by box size
so a 56px front sheet and a 64px gen1 back sheet do not rebuild each other); a
sheet's per-sheet cost is nil.

**Shard colour.** Each shard samples the pattern at its **centroid**, and that
window's brightness is autocontrast-stretched between the `CONTRAST_LO` (10th)
and `CONTRAST_HI` (97th) percentiles, smoothstepped (`CONTRAST_GAIN` = 1.0) and
quantised to `FACET_LEVELS` = 6 steps — six discrete brightness plates, not a
ramp. Each plate becomes the sheet's type-tinted film colour: a `FILM_DARK` 0.24
→ `FILM_LIGHT` 0.45 ramp toward white, plus `IRID_GAIN` 1.2 of extra chroma so
the crystal is more saturated than the flat type colour. `FILM_DARK` is the whole
dark end of that ramp, so it is the knob for "the dark shards are too black": it
was lifted from 0.20 to 0.24, which is exactly 20% more light in the darkest
plates (the `FILM_DARK`-weighted part of every colour) without touching the lit
end or the plate count — the histogram of a filmed sprite moves its mass up out
of the darkest bins while the mean rises only slightly, which is what a lift of
the *dark parts* alone should do.

**Bevel.** Shard boundaries are welded as a light/dark pair: the side whose
right/below neighbour is a different shard is pulled toward `b.seamLit` — the
type's colour carried `SEAM_TINT` = 0.55 of the way to white, so the highlight
stays on the crystal's own hue instead of flashing a neutral white — by
`SEAM_STRENGTH` = 0.16, and the opposite side is deepened (`SEAM_DARK` = 0.34).
That bright-edge-next-to-dark-edge pairing is most of what makes the planes read
as bevelled cut facets rather than a flat mosaic. Both halves are deliberately
much subtler than the bright white grid line an earlier version drew: at full
strength that line read as an unnatural lattice sitting on top of the sprite
rather than a crack in a stone.

**Specular.** A whole facet can catch a glare: shards whose *pre-quantisation*
brightness clears `SPEC_T0` = 0.90 light up flat to `SPEC_STRENGTH` = 0.6 of
white with a `SPEC_POW` = 3.0 falloff. It keys off the smooth value rather than
the quantised plate, so the glare lands on the genuinely brightest facets
instead of flooding a whole brightness band.

**Rim.** A chamfered rim traced from distance-to-transparent (inside the content
box) glows with `RIM_TINT` = 0.35 of the type colour at `RIM_STRENGTH` = 0.90,
fading inward over `RIM_FALLOFF` = 2.5 pixels.

**Star glints.** `STAR_COUNT` = 9 white 4-pointed stars are stamped on the
crystal. Their anchors are chosen from the creature's own **opaque pixels of the
first baked frame** (the old pattern-space picks mostly landed outside the
silhouette and never showed), and only from the **interior** of a shard (a
**seam-free** pixel — the crystal's *clearest* planes, not its bevel lines).
The score is the pixel's **own baked brightness** (the film composited over the creature, with the shard's lit level
only a tie-breaker), so the sparkles settle on the **lightest** places the eye
reads as clear and bright — not merely on the shards whose *pattern* sample was
light, which bake dark when they lie over a dark part of the creature. Anchors
are thinned `STAR_SPACING` = 0.21 of the box apart so they spread over the
creature, and a star is stamped with the bake's own magnification
(`TERA.starsFor`): a scale-1 bake gets the nominal star, a 4× bake gets a 4×
blocky star, so a sparkle is always the same size in the *creature's* pixels
rather than a speck the resample swallows. `STAR_SPRITE` picks the size in
stamped pixels — the footprint is what the eye reads. All four sizes are now the
same **shape**: a four-pointed star with a solid white heart and one tapering arm
on each of its four sides, and **nothing on the diagonals**. (An earlier star
filled its diagonals too, which at sprite scale made a round blob — it read as a
circle, not a star, however bright the centre was.) **1** is a five-pixel star:
one white pixel and four arms at 0.80. **2** — the default — is nine pixels: the
heart, arms `±1` at 0.82, and shorter arms `±2` at 0.34. **3** is thirteen pixels
(`±1` 0.84, `±2` 0.52, `±3` 0.24) and **4** seventeen (`±1` 0.85, `±2` 0.58, `±3`
0.32, `±4` 0.16). The weight is how far that pixel is pulled toward white, so the
heart is solid light while the points soften into the facet they lie on. A user
who wants them smaller again sets `STAR_SPRITE` to 1.

**A sparkle is made of light.** Every weight in every sprite is **positive**: a
stamped pixel is blended *toward white* by its weight and keeps the rest of
whatever facet sits under it, so the shard shows **through** the star, which only
ever brightens. Earlier versions also deepened a ring around each star — a
negative-weight **dark halo** whose pixels were multiplied by `1 + w` — on the
theory that a dark ring is what makes a tiny bright star legible on a light
crystal. In practice, on a light sky, gem or water tile the creature is standing
on, that ring read as a dirty smudge around every glint, so the halo is gone and
the stamp pass no longer even has a darkening branch. Verified by diffing a bake
against the same sheet baked with `STAR_COUNT` = 0: the sparkles brighten hundreds
of pixels and darken exactly none.

**The sparkles are their own animation.** The star field is not one fixed
constellation stamped identically into every frame. Each anchor is dealt, from
the deterministic hash, a **phase** and a whole number of **pulses per loop**
(1…`STAR_MULT` = 2) — whole pulses so the twinkle is seamless when the animation
wraps, and only a couple of them so the stars breathe rather than flicker. Per frame every star's weights are multiplied by a pulse of its own cycle:
the pulse is fully off while its wave is below `STAR_FLOOR` = 0.30, ramps to full
at `STAR_FULL` = 0.75, and holds in between (a clear ON stretch and a clear OFF
stretch, rather than a star that hovers at half brightness forever), and a star
below `STAR_MIN` = 0.06 is not stamped at all, so a nearly-dead twinkle leaves no
faint grey residue on the facet. The result: as the sprite animates, the lit
stars keep blinking on and off all over the lightest facets on a cycle of their
own.

**Composition.** The film, its bevel, its specular, its rim and its stars are all
baked into the frame together:

```
out.rgb = (1 - MIX_FILM) * sprite + MIX_FILM * film
out.a   = sprite.a            -- the sprite's own alpha; never the frame's box
```

with `MIX_FILM` = 0.70 by default. The **TERA TRANSPARENCY** row overrides it to
`1 - transparency/100` (5% → 0.95, 60% → 0.40), resolved once per sheet and stored
on the bake as `b.filmMix`; every other stage (bevel, specular, rim, stars) is an
affine map of the mixed pixel, so the row changes only *how much* crystal there
is, never its shape or colour. Everything is mapped in **destination box space**.

**Travelling with the sprite (ANIMATION RIDE).** The crystal is not nailed to the
picture box while the creature bobs inside it — that reads as a flat glass pane
swimming over the sprite. The scan records each frame's **content centroid**
(`b.fcx` / `b.fcy` / `b.fn`, accumulated as the sheet is read in chunks,
`scanChunk`), and when a frame is baked the whole lattice is sampled at that
frame's displacement from the first frame's centroid, converted to destination
pixels and clamped to `±PAD` (`PAD` = 12). The facets, the bevels, the rim and the
sparkle anchors all shift together as one rigid body, so the crystal *rides* the
sprite's own motion. To allow that translation without running off the pattern,
the lattice is cut over a `PAD`-pixel margin all round the content box
(`DW = dw + 2·PAD`, `DH = dh + 2·PAD`); the pattern window and facet scale are
still measured against the real content box, so the margin changes nothing at
rest — the shards just outside the box are clipped away by the silhouette rule as
usual. (Verified against the real sheet: a pure-lattice bake of PIKACHU frame 4
vs frame 0 cross-correlates at exactly the frame's content-centroid shift, with a
zero-error peak at the matching integer offset.)

**Type colours.** The full 18-type palette is in `main.lua` (`TERA_TINT`). It
follows the Scarlet/Violet type colours, with these overrides:

| Type | Colour |
|---|---|
| NORMAL | shiny white |
| WATER | `#2980EF` (the chart's water blue) |
| FLYING | sky blue |
| STEEL | metallic gray |
| STELLAR | shiny silver |

`???` is deliberately **absent** from the table: an unmapped type simply draws no
film, which is also what any future type id gets.

**Where the state comes from.** Terastallization is not this mod's; it belongs to
`battle_forms`, and the mod only **reads** the result. The read is the
**engine's own record**, because that is the durable one: `g9-battle-engine` sets
`mon.teraActive` on its `mod.battle_forms.tera_applied` listener and owns the
per-mon Tera type (`gigantamax/tera_state.lua`'s `getTeraType(mon)`), so the film
is painted from the very value the engine's own combat code uses. A
`battle_forms` `describe()` payload is still consulted as the fallback -- the
original seam -- but it is not a shape this mod can rely on across builds, and
depending on it alone is why a Terastallized Pokemon could draw with **no crystal
layer at all**. A custom battle screen may also **declare** the live type (on the
battler as `liveTeraType`, or through the draw seam as `ctx.liveTeraType`); the
scene reads the same engine state, so the two always agree. The mod then bakes a
**per-type variant** of that sprite sheet on the existing budgeted build path
(so a mid-battle Terastallize never stalls a frame).

**Declared raid bosses.** A *wild* Tera raid boss is the one case the live read
cannot answer. `g9-Battle-Scene`'s `special_boss.lua` stamps the boss with its
Tera type, and its opening F-box announces it ("You have found a Tera WATER
Krabby raid!"), but it deliberately never *activates* the gimmick — `battle_forms`
only ever activates on the player's side — so there was no live state for this
mod to read and the boss drew ordinary, i.e. the announcement and the sprite
disagreed. The screen now also hands the mod that declaration: it copies
`battle.g9BossKind` onto the boss battler as `g9RaidGimmick` right after the
battle screen is built, `battle_screen.lua`'s `resolveSprite` forwards it as
`ctx.boss` / `ctx.bossGimmick` on the `battle.mon_pic` seam, and this mod paints
the declared type's film when the live read found nothing. The declaration is
**visual only** — it never activates the gimmick, never touches the mon, and
carries no mechanics.

**A custom screen can hold the film back (`__g9TeraHold`).** `g9-Battle-Scene`'s
animated terastallization sequence builds a crystal construct around the
creature and only wants the film on it when that construct **breaks** — the
reveal. So while the scene has a sequence staged it sets `__g9TeraHold` on the
battler, and this mod answers "no film yet" for that battler — in both the live
read and the declared-raid-boss branch. The scene clears the flag on the reveal
frame and the film appears. This is what lets a mon whose tera is already active
(a player's, and an **enemy/boss** whose `battle_forms` activated it) draw
ordinary — and whitening inside the shell — for the whole show, instead of
wearing the crystal from the first frame. The flag may be a boolean (`true` =
held until cleared) **or a number** — an absolute `love.timer` deadline, which
is what the scene now writes: the film is held only until that time passes, so a
missed clear can never hide the crystal forever. On any battler without the flag
the behavior is exactly as before; an unreadable clock degrades to "paint".

**Only a live or declared state paints** — a Pokemon that merely *has* a Tera
type does not wear the film until it actually transforms (or is a declared raid
boss). A real live state always wins over a declaration, an unmapped/absent
declared type draws nothing, and the same option gate applies: with TERA ART off
neither paints.

Everything about the lookup is forgiving, because `battle_forms` is optional and
may arrive late: a missing mod, a missing export, a raised error or a missing
field all mean "no film" rather than a broken battle. If the filmed sheet is
still baking when the battle needs it, the **plain** frame is drawn instead, so
the sprite never blanks — the crystal simply pops in a tick later.

## DYNAMAX GROW (the size ladder)

A **Dynamaxed or Gigantamaxed** sprite grows through a fixed ladder of size
phases, on real time, and -- when the transformation ends -- **shrinks back
down the very same ladder at the very same rates**, so the whole dramatic
process reads forward and then in reverse. The ladder is:

| Phase | Scale | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| start | 1.00 | -- |
| 1 | 1.05 | 0.30 s |
| 2 | 1.10 | 0.40 s |
| 3 | 1.20 | 0.50 s |
| 4 | 1.50 | 0.80 s |

**Parabolic, not linear.** Each phase eases IN on `t*t`: the growth is gentle at
the phase's start and dramatic just before the next phase begins, so a whole
0.30 s phase feels like it "catches" and then leaps. The factor is a pure
function of elapsed time, so it is identical on every machine and cannot
desync from the sprite clock.

**The shrink is the grow, run backwards.** When the transformation ends the
ladder is not cut short with a quick fall: the mod records how far up the
ladder the mon had climbed and then walks the exact phases back down, at the
same durations and the same `t*t` curve. A full 1.50 -> 1.00 descent takes the
same 2.00 s the climb did, and a mon that reverted while still small shrinks
for exactly as long as it grew. `GROW.elapsedFor(factor)` is that inverse -- the
time at which the ladder first reaches a given factor -- so the fall is a
mirror by construction, never a second set of numbers to keep in step.

**Two seams, one ladder.** On **Gen 1** the mod wraps the engine's own
`drawBattlerPic` and scales about the picture's bottom-centre -- so the feet
stay planted and the creature grows upward -- whenever the factor is above
1.001. On **Gen 2** the pack's own `picScale` seam returns the factor. The
ladder is read from the live Dynamax state (the same forgiving read the Tera
film uses), so it starts when the transformation lands and shrinks when it
reverts; a mon that merely *can* Dynamax is drawn normally. **DYNAMAX GROW**
off draws every mon at its normal size -- but the state is still reported (see
below), so a custom battle screen's field FX do not silently depend on this
row.

**What the battle screen reads.** The mod exposes
`mod.exports.dynamaxStateOf(mon, battler)`, a small table:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `active` | the live read says the mon is Dynamaxed/Gigantamaxed right now |
| `known` | the mod holds a ladder record for this mon -- true while it is transformed **and through the shrink**, clearing only on the frame the descent ends |
| `grow` | the current size factor (1.00 when idle) |
| `shrinking` | the ladder is currently descending |

The only consumer is `g9-Battle-Scene`'s **DYNAMAX FIELD** FX (its
`dynamax_field.lua`): `grow` is what its `charge` maps to the darkened field
and the red aura, and `known` is what tells its sprite loop to **hold a
fainted Dynamaxed mon on screen, still shrinking,** until the descent is done
-- only then does the mon burst and vanish (see that mod's README). Everything
about the read is forgiving: a missing mod, a missing export, a raised error or
a missing field all mean "not transformed" rather than a broken battle; with
the sprite mod absent the scene simply draws every mon at its normal size.

**Declared raid bosses.** A *wild* Dynamax/Gigantamax raid boss has no live
state either (see [TERA ART](#tera-art-the-crystal-film)): `special_boss.lua`
records its kind and announces it but never mechanically activates the gimmick.
The screen hands this mod that declaration as `ctx.bossGimmick =
{ kind = "dynamax" | "gigantamax" }`, and the live read falls back to it. The
declaration is **visual only**; a real live state still wins.

**A custom screen can hold the ladder back (`__g9DynHold`).** `g9-Battle-Scene`
stages the transformation as a sequence and wants the creature to stay at its
ordinary size until the clip's **reveal** beat, where the growth is supposed to
start. While a sequence is staged it raises `__g9DynHold` on the battler and
clears it on the reveal, and this mod answers "not Dynamaxed" for that battler —
in **both** the live read and the declared-raid-boss branch (the declared branch
honours it as of 3.3.2; it had started the ladder the moment a declared boss
appeared, so the creature crept up to size underneath the whole sequence being
played over it). The flag is only ever up mid-sequence, so a declared boss drawn
outside one grows exactly as it always did. On any battler without the flag the
behavior is identical.


## BATTLE SHADOWS (the contact shadow)

The game's battle screens draw **no shadow** under a battler, so without one a
Pokemon looks like it is floating. This mod bakes a contact shadow **behind**
each battler — never as a second draw pass, so it rides the same frame as the
sprite and can never flicker with the frame clock.

**Where the art comes from.** The DBK solo-sprite pack ships no shadow art: its
own games squash the battler's frame into a soft, semi-transparent blob at draw
time, which the mod cannot reproduce from a single sheet. So the shadows are the
game's own small/medium/large **contact shadows** — `assets/shadow/1.png`,
`2.png` and `3.png`, taken from **La Base de Sky**'s
`Graphics/Pokemon/Shadow` folder (52×16, 72×16 and 100×20, a 30%-alpha black
blob each). The art's own content box is measured once (the files carry a thin
transparent rim) and the shadow is scaled and centred by it.

**Which shadow a species wears** is resolved the way Essentials' own
`shadow_filename` does it, in two steps:

1. a species file, `assets/shadow/<STEM>.png`, wins if it exists (drop your own
   art in per species — this is the escape hatch for a Pokemon whose shadow you
   want to draw by hand);
2. otherwise the **generic** art is picked by the pack's own `ShadowSize`, from
   `data/dbk_metrics.lua` — clamped to the three files — where **`ShadowSize 0`
   means that species casts no shadow at all**. The generic mapping is
   `1.png ← ShadowSize ≤ 1`, `2.png ← 2`, `3.png ← ≥ 3`.

**How big and where.** The shadow's **width** is a share of the sprite's own
display width that tracks `ShadowSize`: `0.55` at the default `1`, `+0.10` per
point above (`2 → 0.65`, `3 → 0.75`, …) and `−0.05` per point below
(`−1 → 0.50`, `−2 → 0.45`, …), clamped to `0.15 … 1.00`. The pack's
**ShadowSprite x** offset (`data/dbk_metrics.lua`, field `sx`) then nudges it
sideways, converted exactly like the sprite's own pack alignment (`x × 2 ÷
renderScale`, scaled with the sheet). Its **second and third** values (ally/enemy
y offsets) are deliberately ignored: a baked shadow is always pinned to the
**ground line** — the bottom of the frame the battle screen anchors to — so a
floating Pokemon's shadow correctly stays on the ground while the Pokemon hovers
above it (see FLOATERS). The composite is an ordinary `sprite OVER shadow` per
pixel, so the Pokemon's opaque pixels occlude the shadow's middle exactly as feet
should, while its transparent margin lets the shadow through.

**Scope.** The shadow is baked only for a **battle** seam (`sheet.shadow`, set by
`getBattleFrames`), so the Pokedex and Summary pictures — which share the very
same baked frame — never grow a shadow. Both the game's own battle screens and a
custom `g9-Battle-Scene` battle get it.

> **Note — double shadow.** `g9-Battle-Scene` already draws its own primitive
> ellipse shadow under a battler when a background image is present. With BATTLE
> SHADOWS on *and* a scene background up, a scene battle therefore shows both
> this shadow and the scene's. Turn BATTLE SHADOWS off if you prefer the scene's
> own primitive one.

`ShadowSize` and `ShadowSprite` are not shipped in the game's data; they are
parsed out of the pack's own PBS files by
[`tools/rebuild_dbk_metrics.mjs`](tools/rebuild_dbk_metrics.mjs) (see
[Regenerating the data](#regenerating-the-data)).

## EGGS (the one egg picture)

A Pokemon egg has no species sheet of its own and no icon of its own, so every
egg is drawn from **one still image shipped with the mod** —
`assets/egg.png`, La Base de Sky's `Graphics/Pokemon/Eggs/000.png` trimmed to
its own **56×60** pixels (the pack's 160×160 source has a wide transparent
margin; the trim keeps only the art). That one picture is *the egg*, wherever an
egg is shown:

| Where | How it is drawn |
|---|---|
| the party list's 16×16 icon slot (gen1 and gen2) | fitted to the slot — the egg is **shrunk** to 16 design pixels on its longer side, so the classic party list shows a small egg exactly where the game's own egg icon would go |
| the 64px cell of **G9 PARTY SCREEN** | the same fit, so on the 4× page the egg lands near its own pixels in the cell |
| g9-gui's party **portrait cards** and its **PC mon panel** | through the always-on `frontArt` export, the same channel the pack's front sheets use — the egg *is* this mon's front art |
| the **summary** picture slot | through `drawSummaryFrame`, the same slot and anchoring every other summary picture uses |

It is a still, so an egg is **never** sliced into animation frames and never goes
through the sheet baker — the exports above answer the egg directly. An egg's
"battle sprite" is therefore this same picture: an egg can never be dragged
into a battle (the engine keeps eggs out of every battle path), but the art
channel is the same one, so nothing special has to be done anywhere.

To change the egg art later: drop a new `assets/egg.png` in (any size — callers
fit it by its longer side) and nothing else has to move. A build whose
`assets/egg.png` cannot be read warns **once** and keeps the pack's old atlas
`000` egg icon, so the egg is never left blank.

## The Pokémon Tower ghost (gen 1)

Until the **Silph Scope** is in the bag, every wild battle in Pokémon Tower —
and the scripted ghost **Marowak** — is fought against a **"GHOST"**: the
engine swaps the enemy's name and pic for its own
`assets/generated/battle/front/ghost.png` and keeps whatever is underneath
hidden behind that picture (`BattleState`'s `makeGhost` without the Scope, and
`makeUnveiledGhost` with it). **The pack must not paint its sheet over that
disguise** — being unable to tell what is underneath is the whole encounter,
and in the vanilla game the real sprite stays masked until the Scope is held —
so the gen-1 seam hands the engine's own ghost pic straight through: the enemy
keeps the game's ghost, at the **game's own scale**, with **no** true-colour
mark (the ghost is the engine's palette-processed pic, not one of our pre-baked
frames).

The check is **species-blind on purpose**. A randomizer may replace whatever the
disguise hides (the shipped `g9-battle-sample` randomizes the tower's wilds too,
and any other randomizer may), so keying on Marowak — or on any species — would
both miss a randomized ghost and, worse, paint over an ordinary Marowak fought
somewhere else. The mod reads the engine's **own disguise bookkeeping** instead,
fields set by nothing else:

| field | set by | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `battle.ghost` | `makeGhost` | no Scope — the mon only flees, never attacks, balls fail |
| `battle.scopeReveal` | `makeUnveiledGhost` | the Scope is held; the reveal is playing |
| `battle.ghostReveal` | `queueScopeReveal` | the flash/fade itself |

`ghostReal` is deliberately **not** read: the disguise sets it and nothing ever
clears it, so it stays truthy for the rest of the battle — including after a
Scope reveal, when the real mon *should* be shown in the pack's art again. The
guard is scoped to the one `drawPicsLayer` call, so an ordinary battle for the
same species still gets the pack's frame. Gen 1 only: Gold has no tower ghost
(`makeGhost` is absent on the Gen-2 facade), and no layout battle scene runs the
scope-less ghost (the sample scene bails on `battle.ghost` on purpose); with the
Scope held the mon is identified, so the scene draws it normally.

## PARTY ICONS (the bundled icon atlas)

The little **16×16 icon** on each party-list row (gen1 and gen2) does **not** come
from the DBK sheet — the engine's own party icons are a shared two-colour sheet,
and shrinking a battle sheet into a 16×16 slot would throw away the art. Instead
the mod **ships its own animated true-colour icon atlas**, built at development
time from the third-party **"icones animados"** pack:

* the pack is a folder of PNGs, one per icon, each **128×64** = two 64×64
  animation frames side by side (right frame = left frame bobbed a couple of
  pixels);
* at build time each 64×64 frame is **point-sampled 4:1** to a **16×16** cell
  (nearest neighbour, sampled at each 4×4 block's centre, so no colours are
  invented and edges stay hard);
* an icon's two frames become **two consecutive cells**, and the icons are
  packed row-major into **`assets/icons/party_icons.png`** (`cols = 60`,
  cell = 16, two frames);
* **`data/icon_data.lua`** maps `species id → icon name → cell`, plus
  `female` (base name → the pack's female variant) and the egg's `000` cell.

So, unlike every other picture here, an icon is **not baked per mon**: the mod
decodes the one atlas (once, warmed off the draw path from `core.update`) and
draws a **Quad** over it — `frameIndex(2)` picks which of the two cells, so
ANIMATE/SPRITE SPEED drive it like any other sheet. `SPRITE FEMALE` selects the
female cell where the pack has one; an egg is drawn from `assets/egg.png` (see
*EGGS*); a species the pack has no entry for falls straight through to the
game's own icon.

gen1's `PartyMenu.drawIcon` (a **module function**) is wrapped; it marks the
16×16 rect true-colour (`PaletteFX.markTrueColor`) for the SGB/GBC zone pass,
exactly like the battle and summary arms. gen2's `PartyMenu:drawIcon` is wrapped
and draws **raw in GBC mode** (the engine's own `trueColor` rule — through the
party palette shader only in DMG/CLASSIC), while still reproducing the engine's
**held-item marker** by drawing our icon's three 8×8 quadrants and the marker
tile in place of the bottom-left one. A missing or unreadable atlas is never
fatal: the mod logs one warning and every row keeps the vanilla icon.

The icon atlas is regenerated by [`tools/rebuild_icon_atlas.mjs`](tools/rebuild_icon_atlas.mjs)
— see [Regenerating the data](#regenerating-the-data). The source pack is
third-party fan art and is **not** shipped (only the two atlases built from it
are); its credits are in `manifest.json`.

## G9 PARTY SCREEN (the 4x page)

Off by default. When on, the party list is **not** a new screen: it is the
game's own party page, drawn by the game's own code from the game's own tiles
and fonts — just on a **640×576** surface instead of 160×144, with the party
menu's draw running under a `scale(4,4)` transform. Upscaling the *existing*
draw is what keeps the layout honest: the two-line rows, the name / level / HP
figures, the HP-bar tiles, the status and FNT text, the cursor, the CANCEL row
and the box all keep **exactly** the proportions the game gives them, because
they are literally the same draws. Whichever generation boots supplies its own
art — gen 1's tiles on Red/Blue/Yellow, gen 2's on Gold/Silver/Crystal. Nothing
is re-created from the mod's own artwork; the mod adds no layout of its own.

The whole point of the 4× page is the icons. `G9 PARTY SCREEN` draws from
**`assets/icons/party_icons_hd.png`** — the *same* icon pack as PARTY ICONS, but
packed at the pack's **natural 64×64** frames and in the **same order** as the
16×16 atlas, so `data/icon_data.lua`'s one cell index addresses either file
(`hdCell` / `hdCols` in that data say which). The icon still lands in the party
row's own 16×16 design slot, but on the 4× page 16 design units are 64 screen
pixels — **1:1 with the art**, so the frames are shown at full resolution with
no downsampling at all. (With the row off, or the atlas unreadable, the code
falls back to the 16×16 atlas exactly as PARTY ICONS does.) PARTY ICONS still
governs whether the pack's art is used; the species/form/female/egg mapping,
the frame clock and gen 2's held-item marker are all unchanged.

**For other mods.** The same high-resolution frames are available whether or not
`G9 PARTY SCREEN` is on, through the module export
`mod.find("g9-battle-sprites").exports.iconArtHD(mon, frame)`. It answers
`(quads, image, cellPixels, box)` — `quads` is the per-cell quad table
(`full` / `tl` / `tr` / `br`), `image` is the decoded HD atlas, `cellPixels`
is the frame size (64) and `box` is the `{x, y, w, h}` bounding box of the
frame's opaque pixels, in cell pixels — and returns `nil` when the pack has no
icon for that Pokemon or the atlas could not be decoded (the atlas is decoded
lazily, so the first call of a session can answer `nil` and the caller's next
frame gets the art). `box` is `nil` when the pixels cannot be read (no alpha
channel, a stubbed/compressed image) or when the whole cell is opaque; it is
there because the frames are BOTTOM-anchored with spare transparent rows
*above* the creature, so a caller cropping a head space cannot use a fixed
top-anchored window — it would land on blank rows for many species.
`frame` is **optional** and 0-based: pass one of the pack's two frames per icon
to get **that** frame's quad and cell, and for `iconArtHD` **that** frame's own
`box` (each frame's creature sits at its own rows — the pair bobs). Omit it (or
pass `nil`) for the LIVE frame, which is what this export always answered
before the argument existed, so an existing caller is never affected. `g9-gui`
("modern UI & stats") is the current caller: its party roster crops each
`box`-anchored head space into a portrait card, and its ICONS-only PARTY
PORTRAITS animation asks for frame 0/1 on its own one-second clock so the
portrait steps at the rate it wants (not this mod's `SPRITE FPS`) with a crop
that stays put. The export is **not** the same thing as the internal `iconArt`
used by the party screen, which is gated on the option.

Three further exports hand the pack's art to other mods **whatever this mod's
options are set to**:

* `mod.find("g9-battle-sprites").exports.frontArt(mon)` answers
  `(image, width, height, box, head)` — the Pokemon's FRONT sheet
  (`assets/front/<STEM>.png`) baked to frame **1 ALONE**, trimmed to that
  frame's own pixels, as a standalone frame Image at 1:1 — so a caller
  cropping the head can treat the frame's top as the creature's top. `box` is
  that frame's own content box inside the image, always `{x=0, y=0, w, h}`
  (the trim IS the content), and it is answered so a caller can tell this
  frame-1 bake apart from an older copy's WHOLE-ANIMATION union bake, which
  answers no fourth value: the union bake left frame 1 dozens of transparent
  rows below its top (DRAGONITE's Mega frame has 51), so a card cropping from
  the top landed on blank rows. It answers `(nil, pending)` while the sheet is
  still baking (the same `core.update` budget that bakes the battle sheets), or
  `nil` when the pack has no sheet for that species. LÖVE 11.5 has no Image
  pixel readback — `Image:newImageData` / `Image:getData` do not exist there —
  so the box comes out of the bake itself rather than a scan of the decoded
  image; for the same reason the `g9ContentBox` behind `iconArtHD`'s own `box`
  scans the ImageData the atlas was decoded into.
  `head` (**3.5.1**) is the height, in the frame image's own rows, of a leading
  **head DECORATION** in the frame — Kingambit's blade, Sirfetchd's leek,
  Aegislash's hilt — or `0` when the frame's top IS the head, so a caller can
  start its portrait window BELOW the decoration and show the face. It is
  measured from the ART, never a species list: the portrait bake already scans
  every source row's own opaque width, and a leading run of rows is a
  decoration when the first row reaching a quarter of the creature's widest row
  lies below a run that is *taller than it is wide* (a vertical spike) and is
  at least a fifth of the frame's own height. The size floor is what keeps
  short narrow tips out — Pikachu's 6-row ear tips, Onix's 7-row rock tip — and
  the width test is what keeps genuinely TALL creatures out, whose head reaches
  a real share of the width within a few rows (Eternatus, Lapras, Wailord,
  Dragonite, Milotic, Lugia, Giratina, Alakazam and Samurott all answer 0).
  Against the real pack the rule fires on exactly Sirfetchd (37 rows, 42%),
  Kingambit (29 rows, 32%) and Aegislash's hilt (17 rows, 21%, both forms).
  An older copy answers four values, so `head` is `nil` and a caller keeps the
  old top-anchored crop.
* `mod.find("g9-battle-sprites").exports.iconArt16(mon, frame)` answers
  `(quads, image, cellPixels)` — the per-cell quad table (`full`), the decoded
  16×16 icon atlas and the cell size (16) — for the pack's own
  `assets/icons/party_icons.png`, or `nil` when the pack has no icon for that
  Pokemon. Its optional 0-based `frame` works exactly as `iconArtHD`'s does
  (omit it for the live frame).
* `mod.find("g9-battle-sprites").exports.drawSummaryFrame(mon, box)` answers
  `true` when it drew, and paints the **live animation frame** of the mon's
  FRONT sheet straight into `box` — `{x, w, bottom}`, in the *caller's* own
  coordinate space — centred across the box width and foot-anchored on
  `box.bottom`, mirrored like the engine's own summary picture. It is the same
  picture, at the same size and in the same place the summary screens above
  paint, and it follows `SUMMARY SPRITES` and `SUMMARY SIZE` exactly as they
  do; `NATIVE_SUMMARY_BOX` (`{x = 8, w = 56, bottom = 56}`) is the default
  box. It answers `false` — never an error — when `SUMMARY SPRITES` is off,
  when the pack has no sheet for that mon (eggs and UNOWN included) and while
  the sheet is still baking. A screen that PAINTS ITS OWN PAGE instead of
  running the engine's `SummaryMenu` is reached by neither hook above, so
  this is how it asks for its sprite: `g9-gui`'s ADV.STATS panel calls it
  over the window's top-left corner.

`g9-gui` draws its party portraits from these always-on exports: `frontArt` for
its "BATTLE SPRITES" portraits and the 64×64 HD cell (`iconArtHD`) for its
"ICONS" portraits — both at the pack's own 1:1 pixels — with the 16×16 atlas
(`iconArt16`) only as the fitted fallback for a copy of this mod that has no HD
cell. Its ICONS-only PARTY PORTRAITS animation (g9-gui 3.3.0) asks those two
exports for an explicit 0-based frame on its own one-second clock, so each
portrait steps at the rate it wants rather than this mod's `SPRITE FPS` and
crops to the frame it is actually holding. From **3.5.1** it also reads
`frontArt`'s `head` value and starts its portrait window that many rows down,
so a decorated creature's card shows the FACE (g9-gui 3.8.1).

The action list that opens when you pick a Pokemon — STATS / SWITCH / field
moves / ITEM / CANCEL — is the game's own submenu (`self.submenu` /
`self.subItems`, drawn by the native `drawPanel` / `drawSubmenu` this wraps), so
it behaves and reads exactly as the game's own list does, on the same 4× page.
Anything the party menu opens on top (a summary, a message box) is drawn there
too: a classic 160×144 screen pushed over the party menu is **dressed** in place
(the mod sets its `uiSize`/widescreen answers and runs its draw under the same
4× transform, scaling its true-colour zone marks with it) rather than shrunk
back down. Battles, the Pokedex and the summary's own picture logic are
untouched.

**Coexistence with a screen this mod does not own.** Another mod can take the
same party screen over: `g9-gui` registers its own `PartyMenu` factory and
decorates the *instance* with its own 540×360 POKeMON page, and an instance
field shadows the class surface installed here. The dressing is therefore gated
on the page's **own** answer — `pageOwnsG9Surface` asks the party state on the
stack for `uiSize` and requires 640×576 before dressing anything. Without that
gate the overlay claims 640×576 from under the page that is actually drawing,
and `Game:draw` sizes the surface from the **topmost** wide state, so the page
is drawn as a corner of the bigger canvas (the user-reported "party screen gets
shrunk") and the message box lands outside it ("appears out of it"). With the
gate a taken-over page keeps its own surface and a classic overlay is centred
on it the way the engine centres one, and the 4× page still dresses its own
overlays when it really is the page on the stack.

Mechanically: gen 1's `PartyMenu` answers `uiSize` = 640×576 and
`isWideBattleLayout`/`wantsFillScale` while the row is on, and the mod wraps
`PartyMenu.draw`, `PartyMenu.sgbPalettes` (its 160×144 true-colour zones scaled
×4) and `src.core.StateStack.push` (so a screen pushed over the menu is dressed
as above); a plain `holdsUIAnchors` field is toggled from the `core.update` poll
so the engine only treats the menu as an anchor-holding screen while the page is
on. gen 2 goes through `Game2`'s widescreen path instead: the mod answers
`PartyMenu.battlePanelScale` (`g9FillScale × 4`, where `g9FillScale` is the
window-filling scale of the 640×576 panel) and wraps `PartyMenu.drawWidescreen`
to letterbox and fit that panel, which is also what makes a pushed classic
screen cover the panel instead of floating small in its middle. The high-res
atlas is ~1.9 MB, so it is decoded **only** while the row is on, and warmed off
the draw path from `core.update`. A missing atlas is never fatal: one warning
and every row uses the 16×16 art instead.

## Diagnostics (if sprites don't appear)

The on-screen diagnostics panel is **disabled in shipped builds** (there is no
option row for it, and no `render.compose` hook is installed) because it was
never meant for players to switch on. What it showed — and what is still
written to the game log (stdout) — is:

* `local assets -- front N, front_shiny N, back N, back_shiny N` at load. *All
  zeros* means the shipped sheets are missing from the install (a partial or
  damaged unzip) — the mod then falls back to the game's own art.
* `... is not in assets/<type>/ -- vanilla pic in use` at **info** = a species
  resolved to a stem, but that sheet file is not installed.
* `... could not be used (...)` at **warn** = a sheet is present but failed to
  decode (corrupt, partial, or an unsupported PNG), so the mod falls back to the
  vanilla pic. The parenthesised text names the decode route(s) that were tried
  and why they failed.

Sheets are decoded through up to three routes (the mod's own asset path first,
then the raw bytes, then a graphics detour); if every route fails, the first
failing reason is logged so a bad file or an unsupported PNG can be told apart
from a missing one.
**A hot, progressive, retrying bake (3.3.1).** Building a sheet is spread across frames under a small per-update budget so it never stalls a frame. Three refinements make a first send-out land with its art: (1) a sheet a caller is actively asking for is **hot** -- it steps FIRST, under a larger budget, until the asks stop, so a background bake cannot eat the frame budget while a mon is about to land; (2) the frame array is handed out **progressively** as each frame bakes, so the sprite starts animating from its first frame instead of holding a blank pic; and (3) a sheet that is present but fails to decode -- typically a PNG caught mid-download -- is **retried** a few times before it is latched as unusable, so a file that finishes a moment later is picked up rather than being vanilla for the session. A genuinely missing file is unaffected (still re-checked about every 15s). g9-Battle-Scene 4.0.2 additionally pre-warms both leads the instant a battle screen is built, giving the lead sheets the whole intro as head start.

If the panel is ever needed again, it is still in `main.lua`, dormant behind
`local DEBUG_PANEL_ENABLED = false` — flip the constant and it paints a white
box with black text at the top-left of the finished UI canvas (the engine's
developer console is Gen 1 only, and Gold implements it not at all).

## The `assets/` folders

```
assets/
  front/        front (enemy) sheets      e.g. ABOMASNOW.png
  front_shiny/  front shiny sheets
  back/         back (player) sheets
  back_shiny/   back shiny sheets
  icons/party_icons.png      the PARTY ICONS atlas (16x16 cells)
  icons/party_icons_hd.png   the G9 PARTY SCREEN atlas (the pack's 64x64 frames)
  tera_crystal.png    the TERA ART crystal pattern
  egg.png             the EGG ART: the one picture every egg is drawn with
  shadow/1.png        the BATTLE SHADOWS generic small contact shadow
  shadow/2.png        the BATTLE SHADOWS generic medium contact shadow
  shadow/3.png        the BATTLE SHADOWS generic large contact shadow
```

File name = the pack stem. One horizontal strip per file; never split it.
Each folder has its own README with the details. A species the pack has no sheet
for simply uses the game's vanilla pic. A `shadow/<STEM>.png` file (per
species) overrides the generic `1/2/3.png` for that species.

The mod **ships its full DBK sprite art** — every `front/`, `front_shiny/`,
`back/` and `back_shiny/` sheet — alongside the two party-icon atlases, the
Tera crystal, the egg picture and the three generic contact shadows. The sheets
and icons are community fan art: see [`CREDITS.md`](CREDITS.md) for the full
artist credits (EeveeExpo Resource Pack, La Base de Sky's DBK pack, the
"icones animados" icon pack) and [`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md)
for the licence notes.

## How it hooks the engine

Which generation is booted is read from `src.core.GameVersion.generation()`
(`1` = Red/Blue/Yellow, `2` = Gold/Silver/Crystal) and **only that
generation's battle screen is wrapped**. The generation also picks the asset
**box** a sheet is baked into — a back pic is 64×64 on gen1 and 48×48 on gen2 —
so sheets always land in the box of the game actually running. If the engine
has no `GameVersion` (older than this seam), the mod falls back to probing both
screens, as before.

* **gen1** (`src.battle.BattleState`): wraps `drawPicsLayer` to set each managed
  battler's `sprite` to its current frame `Image` right before the vanilla draw,
  and forces `resolveBattleScale → 1` for managed species (our frames are already
  baked to the box size). `drawBattlerPic` is wrapped only to mark the pic rect
  **true-colour** (`PaletteFX.markTrueColor`), so the SGB/GBC zone post-pass
  re-blits it unshaded. The **Pokémon Tower ghost** is the one enemy left out:
  while the engine's disguise is up the pack paints nothing over it and hands it
  the engine's own scale — see
  [The Pokémon Tower ghost](#the-pokémon-tower-ghost-gen-1).
* **gen2** (`src.ui.gen2.BattleState`): wraps `pic(mon, back)` to return the
  current frame `Image` with `trueColor = true` (Gold draws a trueColor pic
  raw), and `picScale → 1` for managed species.
* **The Pokedex** (`src.ui.DexEntryMenu` on gen1, `src.ui.gen2.PokedexMenu` on
  gen2): the dex does **not** draw through either battle screen — it asks
  `pokemon.sprite` / `Sprites.pic` for the front pic's **path** and loads that
  file itself, so the engine's `pokemon.sprite` hook (which can only swap the
  path string) can never hand it a frame baked in memory. The mod therefore
  wraps the dex screens' own pic accessors directly: gen1's `DexEntryMenu:draw`
  stashes `self.sprite`/`self.spriteTrueColor`, swaps in the current frame with
  `spriteTrueColor = true`, and restores vanilla on the way out; gen2's
  `PokedexMenu:picFor(species)` returns `frame, true`. The dex resolves the base
  front sheet from the species id (never the female/shiny variant, since the
  entry shows the default artwork), skips `UNOWN` (gen2's `drawUnownPic` has its
  own per-letter routine), and uses the same 56×56 front box both screens draw
  into. **DEX SPRITES** turns it off.

  On **gen1 this same hook is the national dex's own Pokédex screen**. The
  `national_dex` mod patches `src.ui.DexEntryMenu` in memory (its
  `src/dexpage.lua`) into its own page strip — the entry page, then a **STATS
  page** as page 2, then the evolution line and movelist — and bands it with
  LEFT/RIGHT **form browsing** that writes the chosen form onto `self.formId`.
  Three consequences the hook handles: the sheet **follows the form** the screen
  is showing (`self.formId` when it is not the base species, else `self.species`,
  with a form that has no sheet falling back to the base species'), it is applied
  from **both** the `draw` and the `update` wrapper — `national_dex` draws its
  STATS page from its own wrapper of the class and can return before the class
  draw runs, so the draw wrap alone is skipped on exactly the page it most needs
  — and the hook is retried from the `core.update` poll so a load-order race
  cannot leave the entry showing vanilla art for a whole session.
* **The party Summary screen** (`src.ui.SummaryMenu` on gen1, `src.ui.gen2.SummaryMenu`
  on gen2): the summary draws its own front pic, so it needs its own hook. It
  shows the **FRONT** sheet, or the `*_shiny` FRONT sheet for a shiny mon,
  resolved through the same species/form/gender mapping the battle pics use (no
  Tera film or Dynamax growth — those are battle states). gen1's `SummaryMenu:draw`
  runs with `self.sprite` hidden and then paints the frame into the engine's own
  spot itself (mirrored, bottom-anchored, with a `PaletteFX.markTrueColor` over
  it) — self-contained, so it never depends on the engine's own pic draw; gen2's
  `SummaryMenu:drawPic` draws the frame raw into the 7×7 block (skipping the GBC
  4-shade remap in GBC mode, the same true-colour rule `BattleState` uses). Both
  honor **SUMMARY SIZE**, which scales that one draw only — the battle, dex and
  scene seams never read it. `UNOWN` is left vanilla, and an egg is drawn from
  `assets/egg.png` (see *EGGS*). **SUMMARY SPRITES**
  turns it off.
* **The party summary as a pushed screen** (the `screen.pushed` listener): the
  party menu's STATS action opens the summary as the pushed screen id
  `"SummaryMenu"` (`src/ui/PartyMenu.lua`), and that id **is** the party summary
  — the screen national_dex repaints the stats box of. The builtin class is
  covered by the wrap above, but a mod may REPLACE it with a class of its own
  registered under the same id, or otherwise paint the mon's own front pic from
  a pushed `Screen` that is not a `SummaryMenu` subclass (the g9 battle engine's
  wide 256×144 modern STATS screen is one). None of the wrappers above runs for
  those. Rather than disabling or reproducing such a screen, the mod listens for
  `screen.pushed` and decorates **that instance's** `draw`: the screen draws in
  full and only the one picture it would have painted is swapped for the current
  frame. A screen pushed under the party summary's id uses the native 160×144
  picture slot on **both** its pages (mirrored from x=8, feet on the y=56 rule —
  where `src.ui.SummaryMenu` and national_dex's stats-box repaint both live), so
  it is recognised by the id alone even when its pic loads lazily (nil at push);
  any other pushed pic screen is treated as a wide modern screen (its own left
  box, mirrored from x=80, picture page only). `SUMMARY SPRITES` and `SUMMARY
  SIZE` apply here exactly as on the native screen; the native `SummaryMenu`
  (both generations) and the Pokedex entry page are explicitly skipped so
  nothing is ever drawn twice. This is Gen 1 only, where a pushed replacement
  lives. It covers screen-**replacing** *summary* mods only: the national dex's
  own Pokédex STATS page is reached by the Pokedex hook above, never by this
  listener (that screen carries a different flag and `isSummaryScreen`
  explicitly skips it).
* **The party list icons** (`src.ui.PartyMenu` on gen1, `src.ui.gen2.PartyMenu`
  on gen2): each party-list row draws one small **16×16** icon, and — like the
  Pokedex and the Summary — the party menu does not draw through a battle
  screen, so it gets its own hook. The engine's icon sheet is two-colour, so the
  mod ships its own **animated true-colour icon atlas** instead: the
  `icones animados` pack (one 128×64 two-frame PNG per icon) is point-sampled
  4:1 into 16×16 cells at build time (one atlas, two consecutive cells per
  icon), and `data/icon_data.lua` maps a species id — and its female variant —
  to a cell. So an icon is just a **Quad over one decoded atlas** — no per-mon
  bake. gen1's `PartyMenu.drawIcon` (a module function) is wrapped and marks its
  16×16 rect true-colour for the SGB/GBC zone pass; gen2's
  `PartyMenu:drawIcon` is wrapped and draws raw in GBC mode (the engine's own
  `trueColor` rule) while still reproducing the game's held-item marker in the
  icon's bottom-left tile. An egg uses the pack's own egg icon; any species the
  pack has no entry for falls straight through to the game's own icon.
  **PARTY ICONS** turns it off.
* **The g9 party screen** (`src.ui.PartyMenu` on gen1, `src.ui.gen2.PartyMenu`
  on gen2, **G9 PARTY SCREEN** row): instead of a new screen, the mod asks for a
  **640×576** surface (4× the Game Boy screen) and runs the party menu's own
  draw under `scale(4,4)`, so the page is the game's own layout in the game's
  own art, merely at 4× — with the high-resolution 64×64 icon atlas 1:1 in the
  row's 16×16 design slot. gen1 answers `PartyMenu.uiSize` /
  `isWideBattleLayout` / `wantsFillScale`, wraps `PartyMenu.draw` and
  `PartyMenu.sgbPalettes` (its 160×144 true-colour zones scaled ×4), and wraps
  `StateStack.push` so a classic screen pushed over the menu is **dressed** in
  place (given the 640×576 answers and the same 4× draw, its true-colour marks
  scaled with it) rather than shrunk; a `holdsUIAnchors` field is toggled from
  the `core.update` poll. gen2 answers `PartyMenu.battlePanelScale`
  (`g9FillScale × 4`) and wraps `PartyMenu.drawWidescreen` to letterbox and fit
  the panel — which is also what centres a pushed classic screen on it. The
  native `drawPanel`/`drawSubmenu` supply the STATS / SWITCH / field-moves /
  ITEM / CANCEL list unchanged. See
  [G9 PARTY SCREEN](#g9-party-screen-the-4x-page).
* **Custom battle scenes** (the `battle.mon_pic` seam): wraps `battle.mon_pic`
  to return the current frame `Image` for managed species. The native screens
  above only cover the vanilla renderers — a replacement scene such as
  `g9-Battle-Scene` draws its own pics, resolving each one through the
  `pokemon.sprite` hook and then `battle.mon_pic`. Without this wrap the mod is
  invisible in every scene battle. It passes `(img, ctx)` through untouched for
  unmanaged species, so it composes with other pic mods. A scene may put
  `box = <pixels>` in `ctx` to name the square it will draw the pic into, or
  `box = { w, h }` to name a non-square slot rect; the
  mod then caches a second set of frames baked to exactly that size, so the
  scene's own draw is a 1:1 blit instead of a fractional resample — which is
  what stops a scene on a different canvas from eating the art a second time.
  (`g9-Battle-Scene` passes each sprite's own slot rect.) The same `ctx` may
  also carry `scale`, the field's own size MULTIPLIER applied to every sheet
  (`g9-Battle-Scene` sends the pack's NATURAL 1:1 size for every sprite, and
  1 x 1.6 = x1.6 for its bossFight boss — the "+0.6", bosses only — so a wild
  Pokemon and the same species on your team read identically and each species
  keeps its true relative size); `natural = true` is the mode it now sends
  instead of a slot box, so a sheet is baked at exactly `scale` x its own
  trimmed pixels (no folding into a shared box, which used to make every
  species the same height and width) and only `maxH` can fold it; an older
  `divisor` (one whole-number field scale, applied as 1/divisor) is still
  honoured for g2-Battle-Scene forks. `zoom` is the
  integer the scene will scale the baked box by on its way to the screen, and
  `fill` asks this slot's sheet to GROW to fill its box (a nearest-neighbour
  resample straight to the box, for a screen with no explicit `scale`).
  Finally `maxH` names the pixels from that slot's ground line up to the
  top of the field: a sheet that would rise past it is folded back
  to fit, so nothing is ever clipped at the top of the scene. A scene that sends
  none of these still works, just with the mod's native-box frames.
* **While a sheet is still baking** (its file exists in `assets/`, but it has not
  been decoded/baked yet — the sheet's `"local"`/`"building"` window) the mod
  reports "pending" rather than "no sheet", and each seam suppresses the vanilla
  pic for that window: gen1 blanks `battler.sprite` (the engine skips a nil
  sprite), gen2 returns a nil pic (the engine's `drawPic` early-returns), and the
  `battle.mon_pic` seam returns **`false`**. A scene that knows the token — such
  as `g9-Battle-Scene`, which starts the bake during the pokeball's flight — draws
  NOTHING for that frame instead of the vanilla pic, so a trainer's send-out never
  flashes native art before the pack's frames are ready. A species with no sheet
  at all (or one that fails to decode) still reports "not pending" and falls
  through to the vanilla pic exactly as before, so the token is never a permanent
  blackout. A scene that predates the token reads `false` as "no swap" and draws
  the vanilla pic, i.e. the old behaviour.
* Frame building happens in a `core.update` hook — **never** inside a draw call.
  Resolved sheets are kept in a bounded LRU (64) whose frame `Image`s are dropped
  oldest-first while the raw bytes stay.
* The on-screen **diagnostics panel** (a `render.compose` wrap) is compiled out
  in shipped builds — see [Diagnostics](#diagnostics-if-sprites-dont-appear).

Pic boxes: gen1 front **56×56**, gen1 back **64×64** (pokered's 32×32 pic at 2×),
gen2 front **56×56**, gen2 back **48×48**. Every sheet is baked into that box at
the largest scale it allows and offset by the pack's metrics (see
[Sizes and alignment](#sizes-and-alignment)), so the art keeps as much of its
own resolution as the box can hold and feet placement matches the pack.

## Permissions / dependencies

```json
"permissions": ["engine_internals"]
```

* `engine_internals` — it requires the engine's BattleState modules and PaletteFX.
  No `network` permission: the mod reads only its own `assets/` folder.

There is **no hard dependency** (`dependencies` is empty).

`optional_dependencies`: `national_dex` (the species-id source this mod's form
map is built against), `g9-battle-engine` (the battle engine and its custom
modern STATS summary screen) and `g9-Battle-Scene` (the custom battle scene that
draws through the `battle.mon_pic` seam). None is required.

**`national_dex`** is orders-only here — the mod never calls its API — so with
it absent the mod still runs, resolving species against the running game's own
dex: a species only `national_dex` knows simply never appears in play, and a
species the base cart has resolves exactly the same way (see
[Lookup](#lookup-per-battle-pic)). With `g9-battle-engine` / `g9-Battle-Scene`
absent the mod still animates the native battle screens, the Pokedex and the
native SummaryMenu, and the custom-screen hooks simply stay dormant.
`battle_forms` (the live Tera and Dynamax state for
[TERA ART](#tera-art-the-crystal-film) and
[DYNAMAX GROW](#dynamax-grow-the-size-ladder)) is likewise optional and feature-
detected — a live Tera/Dynamax is read from it when present, and a wild raid
boss's declared gimmick (handed over by `g9-Battle-Scene` on the `battle.mon_pic`
seam) is read without it; with neither a live state nor a declaration, TERA
ART draws nothing and no mon grows.

## Install

Download the zip from the studio's **Mod exports** row
(`⬇ g9-battle-sprites .zip`) and unzip it into the game's `mods/` folder so the
tree is `mods/g9-battle-sprites/{manifest.json,main.lua,...}`.

### The sheets ship in the mod

The mod **ships its full sprite art** — every DBK front / back (and shiny) sheet
for the national dex — inside `assets/front`, `assets/front_shiny`,
`assets/back` and `assets/back_shiny`, plus the party-icon atlases and the
effect art. Nothing is downloaded at runtime and the mod never touches the
network: unzip the mod and the art is there.

The old `assets/download_assets.py` helper (which fetched the pack from GitLab)
is **deprecated and no longer used or shipped** — g9-battle-sprites provides the
full art itself. It is kept only for historical reference and now refuses to
run. The sheets and icons are community fan art: see [`CREDITS.md`](CREDITS.md)
for the full artist credits and [`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md)
for the licence notes.

## Regenerating the data

`data/dbk_data.lua` is generated by joining the national dex species table to
the DBK pack's file listing. The generator script is `tools/rebuild_dbk_data.mjs`
(kept with the studio source, **not** shipped in the mod zip — see `files.json`).
It fetches all four pack folders live from GitLab and combines them with
`tools/mapping.json` (the reviewed national-dex join — species id → stem, which
carries the form decisions). When the pack gains sheets, run:

```
node tools/rebuild_dbk_data.mjs          # rewrites ../data/dbk_data.lua
```

The output is byte-stable for a given pack + mapping. A species whose stem is
not actually present in the pack is dropped, so the Lua never points at a
missing file.

`data/dbk_metrics.lua` is generated from the pack's own five SpeciesMetrics PBS
files (`pokemon_metrics.txt`, `pokemon_metrics_forms.txt`,
`pokemon_metrics_gmax.txt`, `pokemon_metrics_Gen_9_Pack.txt`,
`pokemon_metrics_female.txt`). Point the script at a folder holding those files
(or pass them explicitly):

```
node tools/rebuild_dbk_metrics.mjs /path/to/metrics-dir   # rewrites ../data/dbk_metrics.lua

It keys each section by the same PNG stem the sheet is stored under
(`[SPECIES,form,female]` → `SPECIES_form_female`, dropping empty parts) and drops
any stem the pack has no PNG for. Besides the `fx`/`fy`/`bx`/`by` alignment
offsets it also emits `sz` (the section's `ShadowSize`, omitted when it is the
default 1) and `sx` (the x of `ShadowSprite`), which BATTLE SHADOWS reads.

`data/dbk_float.lua` (the FLOATERS species set) is generated from the PokeAPI
`pokemon` / `pokemon_types` / `types` / `pokemon_abilities` / `abilities` CSV
tables plus `data/dbk_data.lua`'s stem list, by `tools/rebuild_dbk_float.mjs`.
A sheet is flagged airborne if it is a Flying type (minus the handful the pack
draws standing), has the Levitate ability, or is in a small curated set of
floating/airborne species the type/ability data misses (Magnemite/Porygon/Beldum
lines, Beedrill, Deoxys, Castform, Minior, the Vanillite/Klink/Solosis lines,
Comfey, Orbeetle, the airborne Paradox mons). Fetch the CSVs first, then point
the script at the folder (or pass the files explicitly):

```
node tools/rebuild_dbk_float.mjs /path/to/pokeapi-csv-dir   # rewrites ../data/dbk_float.lua
```

It keys off the same stems as `dbk_data.lua` and drops any stem the pack has no
sheet for. The output is byte-stable for a given set of CSVs plus
`dbk_data.lua`.

`assets/icons/party_icons.png`, `assets/icons/party_icons_hd.png` and
`data/icon_data.lua` (the PARTY ICONS and G9 PARTY SCREEN atlases) are generated
from the bundled `tools/icon_pack.zip` icon pack by
`tools/rebuild_icon_atlas.mjs`. It is **browser/worker** code (no Node): run it
from the editor's `execute_js` — the exact snippet is in
[`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md). The output is byte-stable for a given pack
plus `dbk_data.lua`, so rerunning it is a no-op. The tool emits **both** atlases
(the 4:1-downsampled 16×16 one, and the natural 64×64 one) in the same pass, in
the same cell order, so one `icon_data.lua` addresses either.
